# NoteSet

This is C++ code to implement monophony given midi note information.  I don't exactly know what this algorithm is called but it's implemented in almost every synthesizer and was surprised not to see a version on the web for C++. 

Note stack by Olivier Gillet >> NoteSet by kschaffer >> C++ version of NoteSet
This is a version of Kat Schaffer's code that is not reliant on <Arduino.h>.  Should work in C++
